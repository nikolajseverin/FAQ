## My process

### Built with

Im not really sure what to write here, maybe:

HTML
CSS
JS
FLEXBOX

### Continued development

basically i have no idea what to use when. for example.

When should i use px, vh, vw % and so on. For exmaple if i want it to dynamic resizing, to marign, padding and so on. right now im just looking at it feeling when im close to the one im trying to match.
